<h1>Console App Assignment</h1>
<h2>Christmas Shopping list for parents.</h2>

Welcome to the Console App Development Assignment!  In this assignment, I am tasked with creating a console application of my own choice. Using the knowledge aquired from class labs and my previous assignments, I will build a console app containing a shopping list to help parents with their christmas shopping.

<h2>Assignment Brief</h2>
<h3>Minimum Requirements</h3>
The console app must meet the following minimum requirements:

- <h4>Model Class:</h4>
      Define a clear and meaningful Model class that represents the main entity or data structure of your application.
- <h4>Controller Class:</h4>
      Develop a Controller class that manages instances of the Model class. This class should include methods for adding, updating, and retrieving data.
- <h4>Main Class:</h4>
      Create a Main class responsible for user input and output. This class should provide a menu or command-line interface for users to interact with your application.

<h3>Additional Considerations</h3>
While the above requirements provide a basic structure for the console app, I intend to included the following aspects to enhance the overall quality of the assignment:

- <h4>GitHub:</h4>
      Utilize version control using Git and host your repository on GitHub. Make meaningful commits and maintain a clean and well-documented repository.
- <h4>Gradle:</h4>
      Use Gradle for project management and dependency resolution. Ensure that your project structure follows best practices.
- <h4>JUnit:</h4>
      Write unit tests for critical components of your application using JUnit. Aim for good test coverage to validate the correctness of your code.
- <h4>Documentation:</h4>
      Include a README file with clear instructions on how to build, run, and test your console app. Provide information on the purpose of the application and any additional considerations for users or developers.
